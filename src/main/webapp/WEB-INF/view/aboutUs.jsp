	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>At The Shoe Company, we believe style shouldn't demand a huge investment of time or money. Style should be comfortable, 
accessible and easy to achieve. That's why our footwear feels as good as it looks, effortlessly taking you from the board room 
to the restaurant, to the park with your family. We strive to ensure your shopping experience is easy on your wallet, and your 
schedule, by delivering fashion and value to everyone in your household.
The Shoe Company's first location open in 1992 and the chain has since grown to more than 
75 locations across Canada.

The Shoe Company. Great brands. Smart Prices</p>
